This is a write up of the WiCyS 2024 "Chaos At The Casino Challenge" CTF. 
This is their third challenge with Target! And my first challenege that I got the opportunity to participate in.
There were 793 players and the top 15 participants received a WiCyS Scholarship to attend the 2025 WiCyS Conference.
The CTF was divided in 2 categories: Offensive (red Team) and Defense (Blue Team)

WiCyS' Description of the challenge: Cyber Defense Challenge made possible by Target
Get ready for the third annual Target Cyber Defense Challenge! The challenge will give WiCyS members hands-on experience and a taste of what it’s like to be on a cyber defense team. From tackling intel-driven scenarios to experiencing current threats in the landscape, this challenge will offer many learning opportunities for members to hone their cybersecurity skills. In this year’s challenge, play both the threat actor and the defender during a high-stakes attack against a casino!
This engaging program is for WiCyS members to dive in, gain new learning experiences, network with an inclusive cohort of peers, work one-on-one with the Target cybersecurity team, and explore what incident response, threat detection, and threat intelligence are all about.
The top 10 participants will also receive a scholarship to attend the 2025 WiCyS Conference.
No previous cybersecurity experience is required to join this training since it’s a tiered, multi-staged learning opportunity. Link to the webpage: https://www.wicys.org/benefits/cyber-defense-challenge-made-possible-by-target/

This is a write up of the WiCyS 2024 "Chaos At The Casino Challenge" CTF. 
This is their third challenge with Target! And my first challenege that I got the opportunity to participate in.
There were 793 players and the top 15 participants received a WiCyS Scholarship to attend the 2025 WiCyS Conference.
The CTF was divided in 2 categories: Offensive (red Team) and Defense (Blue Team)

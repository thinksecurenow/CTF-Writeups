Problem Description:
  While you're keeping an eye on incoming alerts, you notice an email pop into The Lucky Lion's security inbox from a concerned employee. They report receiving an unexpected email asking them to verify their identity.
  There might be hidden evidence of tampering in this email, since on the surface it looks legitimate. Can you figure out where the attacker might have left a calling card?

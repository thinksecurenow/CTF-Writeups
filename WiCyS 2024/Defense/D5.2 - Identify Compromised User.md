Problem Description:
Alright, we have a good idea of how many users visited the known malicious site, but we should also try to see whether these users actually submitted credentials to the harvester, so let's take a closer look at our Suricata alert logs.
Reviewing the traffic, what field and value indicates that credentials may have been sent to the malicious site?

Objectives:
Enter the field name that indicates a user credentials may have been sent to the malicious site and its value, exactly as in the log (i.e. "field_name": "value")

Tools Required:
Text Editor
